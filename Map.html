    <h1>Hospitals and Hydro Map</h1>

    <h3>Below is a map showing the state of North Carolina divided into the different counties. Within the counties there are hospitals and hydro of all sorts.</h3>

        <h4>The question I wanted to answer revolved around if having a major amount of flowing water in a county would affect the amount of hospitals present. When I was orginally trying to figure out this question I also thought of how many of the hospitals are accounted for in the six most populated counties. Overall my findings to this were 46/157 hospitals in North Carolina came from those six counties. This comes out to almost 30% of the hospitals come in 6% of the counties, and that is an extreme amount. I used the intersection tool to find the hospitals that fit into the highest county list. I also used the difference tool to show the difference in where the water flow compares in those counties. In the higher populated counties it seemed that there was less flowing water and it made way for more hospitals. I used the buffer tool to emphasize the water flowing in the high population counties.</h4>
